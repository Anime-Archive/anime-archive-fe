# Anime Archive Front End
A mobile, web-based, online database of information related to anime. Users can discover new anime or level up their love and fandom for their already favorite anime.
# Motivation
As anime enthusiasts, we can relate to the struggle of having to tracking down anime information, because frankly, all anime is based out of Asian countries (mainly Japan) and thus Anime Archive was born.
